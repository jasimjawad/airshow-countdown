# Airshow Countdown

A futuristic countdown landing page with a neon glass UI and gradient borders.

## 🚀 Quick Deploy (GitHub Pages + Actions)

1. Create a new repo on GitHub under your account (e.g. `airshow-countdown`).
2. Upload these files (or push via Git).
3. GitHub Actions will **auto-deploy** to Pages on push to `main`.
4. Your site will be live at:
   ```
   https://<your-username>.github.io/airshow-countdown/
   ```

> This repo includes a GitHub Actions workflow that uploads the site artifact and deploys to GitHub Pages automatically.

### 📁 Assets
- Replace `assets/background.mp4` with your video (optional). If you don't have one, the page still renders with gradients.
- Keep the relative path `assets/background.mp4` or edit `index.html` accordingly.

## 🛠 Local Preview
Just open `index.html` in your browser.

## 🔧 Customize
- Update the event title, subtitle, and dates in `index.html`.
- Colors are set in CSS variables at the top of the file.
